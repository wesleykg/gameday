## Overview

This package allows you to both check if a NHL team is playing on a specific date and provide you with NHL game information on a specific date.

## gday()

This function, when supplied with a NHL team and date, tells you if that team plays/ed on that day. If no team an/or date is supplied, the Canucks and the current date are used. See the following example.

```{r}
gday(team = "Bruins", date = "2011-06-15")
```
